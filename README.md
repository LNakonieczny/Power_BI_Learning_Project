# Power_BI_Learning_Project
Project created during the course ‘Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence’ by Maven Analytics (lead instructor Chris Dutton). 
Course is available on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/).

Main file is the AdventureWorks_Report_LN_Learning_Project.pbix, it contains report, queries, and data model. If for some reason you need original data sources, they are in the AdventureWorks_Report_Project_source folder. I currently do not have access to the Power Bi Service for publishing to the web option. As a way of preview the pdf version of the report was included in project files.

Technical steps in the project:
-	loading data from the sources and cleaning,
-	shaping connections between data table to build data model,
-	adding calculated columns and measures,
-	building visualizations,
-	choosing appropriate visualization to build report.
